Private cloud (Upfront Hardware costs, Sovereign control, Maintenance responsibility)
-------------
When Security and confidentiality of data is paramount 
Full control over their data and resources as it is their own data center
High levels of data security and operational performance

Public cloud (Capital free scaling, Quick app provisioning and pay as you go cost)
------------
Scalability (To manage unpredictable traffic spikes --> expanding business)
Azure, Amazon, Google and Oracle
shared model
rapidly depoly their services, scale on demand and only pay for what they use

Hybrid cloud (versatile scalability, starategic application placement, organizational governance)
------------
Robust security of a private cloud for sensitive data with the desire to harness the scalability of a public cloud

Benefits of cloud
-----------------
1. High Availability --> downtime reduction, avoid revenue loss and maintain customer trust 
2. Scalability --> During expansion/ High traffic spikes (Vertical scaling --> Scaling up , Horizantal scaling --> Scaling out)
3. Predictability --> for effective budgeting and resource planning
4. Governance
