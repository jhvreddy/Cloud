# What is RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ is a message broker that helps applications communicate with each other asynchronously. It acts as a middleman for sending, receiving, and managing messages between different services or applications. RabbitMQ is based on the **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)** and is widely used for distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven architectures.
# How Does RabbitMQ Work?
1. **Producer** – The application that sends messages.
2. Queue – The storage space where messages are temporarily kept.
Consumer – The application that receives and processes messages.
Exchange – Determines how messages are routed to different queues.
