#RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is a message broker that helps applications communicate with each other asynchronously. It acts as a middleman for sending, receiving, and managing messages between different services or applications. RabbitMQ is based on the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) and is widely used for distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven architectures.
