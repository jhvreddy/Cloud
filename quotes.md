Excellence happens not by accident. It is a process

It's the Will, Not the Skill

Those who hoard gold have riches for a moment.Those who hoard knowledge and skills have riches for a lifetime.

Great things never came from comfort zones.

A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.

You never know what you can do until you try.
